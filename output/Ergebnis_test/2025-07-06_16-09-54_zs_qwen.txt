Starting with Article 1: "Is Early Summer Becoming a Bigger Retail Sales Opportunity?" The title suggests it's about retail sales trends. I'll summarize it, categorize it under consumer trends since it's about shifting sales opportunities. Sentiment is positive because it highlights a growing opportunity. For trend detection, it's about consumer behavior. Predictive intelligence might show a medium-term trend as retailers adjust strategies. Business impact is a 6/10 because it's useful but not critical.

Sentiment is positive as it offers opportunities. Trend detection is about consumer behavior. Predictive intelligence points to a medium-term trend. Business impact is 7/10 because understanding consumer value is crucial.

Article 4: "Customers are ditching Shein and Temu. Can Amazon win them over?" This is about competitive moves and consumer trends. Sentiment is neutral as it discusses a shift. Trend detection involves competitor moves. Predictive intelligence suggests a short-term implication for Amazon. Business impact is 8/10 because it affects market share.

Trend detection covers various areas like technology and sustainability. Predictive intelligence is long-term. Business impact is 9/10 because it's a comprehensive guide.
